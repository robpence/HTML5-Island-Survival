# HTML5-Island-Survival
An HTML5 Island Survival game made with Phaser.io...
I have currently stopped development on this and am now working 
on something similar but in unity as the phaser.io engine was to limiting.

# To run: 
1. Clone or download the github repo.
2. Start the node/express.js server so it runs locally.
	To do this using bash or something similar cd into the project directory
    	and type 'node app.js'
3. In a web browser go to http://localhost:8080/

# Basic Plan / In progress:
1. Better artwork for everything
2. An intro scene to explain whats happening
3. Crafting system and menu
	- Can build buildings
	- Can make tools
	- Can make items
4. Map generation of some kind
5. Add in NPC
	- Scenes with npcs
	- NPCs can give players things
	- NPCs can walk around the island
6. A Day/Time system
	- Items generated on new days
	- ~~Let player sleep to to advance day~~
7. Health, Hunger, and Thirst System
8. Music and Sounds
9. Minigames for things like cooking, fishing, mining, etc
10. Solve Puzzles or Mini Challenges to unlock special items
11. Simple farming system
	- add more crops
	- ~~advancing the day lets the crops grow~~
	- ~~can only farm on tillable/fertile dirt~~
	- ~~can harvest crops~~
